This is my first README entry for Lab 3. This past Saturday we were introduced to our Launch-Tube assignment. I began immediately by 
modifying the Makefile using the same structure as previous labs, however having separate "ALL" and "REM" entries for the launch program 
and the tube program. From there I began doing research on what I will be needing for launch. We had already worked with fork() and 
waitpid() in Lab 1 so after a quick refresh I proceeded to go over execve() and understand how to implement it within the child process.
