This is my first README entry for Lab 3. I began looking over the project and did some research on signal() and pause().There are a lot of 
concepts from previous projects that I've been able to understand better from one lab to the next such as command line arguments or the 
retrieval and printing of process identifiers. I continued with reading the description as well as checking out the usage examples to get 
an idea of where to start on the catcher assignment. After further planning, I began implementing the code.

This is my second README entry for Lab 3. I've had some trouble proceeding with the lab due to some personal issues arrising during the 
current circumstances, as well as some ongoing changes to the workloads of my classes. I'm thankful that Professor Benson is allowing us 
the freedom of not having a specific due date to the assignment as long as we submit them before grading. To be perfectly honest, my main 
priotity over the last few weeks has been my Comp 380 project to make sure that my team and I don't fall back too far as we get near our 
final presentation. However, my 322 work is of major importance as well and falling behind on that would be just as damaging to myself as 
more labs become assigned. Lab 3 has been a challenge as I've been unsure on how to proceed with my code at particular points, but I'm 
receiving help through resources online as well as some tutors I've been video chatting with. I'm just hoping to revert from the 
inconsistencies of the previous weeks and be able to come up with the finished product as soon as possible.

This is my third and final README entry for Lab 3. I'm just about finished with the project. It took me much longer than expected as it's been a month since the actual due date. However, I am confident with my work on this lab and am ready for the challenges that come with
