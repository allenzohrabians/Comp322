This is my first README entry for Lab 3. I began looking over the project and did some research on signal() and pause().There are a lot of 
concepts from previous projects that I've been able to understand better from one lab to the next such as command line arguments or the 
retrieval and printing of process identifiers. I continued with reading the description as well as checking out the usage examples to get 
an idea of where to start on the catcher assignment. After further planning, I began implementing the code.
