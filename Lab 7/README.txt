This is my first README entry for Lab 7. I am still working on Lab 6 but with the official due date of the final labs being tomorrow 
at midnight, I realized it'd be best to evenly spread my time amongst the two. Lab 7 is definitely a challenge unlike the previous 
assignments. Matrices are something I have worked with in the past and understand well. Operations involving blocks is a returning 
concept from Comp 222, however it is something I have struggled with during that course. My days are limited even though Professor 
Benson has made it clear that we may submit them after the due date as long as they're in prior to grading. Next Wednesday contains 
the bulk of my finals so as we near that date, studying is the priority along with working on these two labs so that immediately 
following exams I can comfortably transition into the final stages of my 322 projects.

This is my second and final README entry for Lab 7. During the last 10 days since the initial entry I'd been having a lot of 
difficulty navigating through this assignment and eventually needed to contact a tutor for assistance. The main struggle was with 
matrix_add and getting a grasp of the logic behind the operations that had to be performed. After that, it became much easier to 
finish up with a well functioning program. I feel like what made this lab stand out from the rest was how brief the description was as 
opposed to the step by step format from those that came before it. Overall, this was definitely the toughest lab for my efforts. 
Completing it 9 days after it was due definitely wasn't in the plan, but I am thankful that Professor Benson allowed us the extra time 
to turn in our last few assignments.
