Thursday (5/7/2020):
This is my first README entry for Lab 7. I am still working on Lab 6 but with the official due date of the final labs being tomorrow 
at midnight, I realized it'd be best to evenly spread my time amongst the two. Lab 7 is definitely a challenge unlike the previous 
assignments. Matrices are something I have worked with in the past and understand well. Operations involving blocks is a returning 
concept from Comp 222, however it is something I have struggled with during that course. My days are limited even though Professor 
Benson has made it clear that we may submit them after the due date as long as they're in prior to grading. Next Wednesday contains 
the bulk of my finals so as we near that date, studying is the priority along with working on these two labs so that immediately 
following exams I can comfortably transition into the final stages of my 322 projects.
