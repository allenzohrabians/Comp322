This is my first README entry for Lab 4. I went over the dining philosopher problem through my readings of the textbook from a few weeks 
back. Now looking over the project description, I have a good idea on how to begin but will continue doing research on semaphores and 
how to work with them which will lead to planning out my implementation. I also want to look into exactly how the bash script for the 
assignment should be written, however making sure I'm well ahead on the dining-p program is the main priority.
