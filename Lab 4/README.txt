This is my first README entry for Lab 4. I went over the dining philosopher problem through my readings of the textbook from a few weeks 
back. Now looking over the project description, I have a good idea on how to begin but will continue doing research on semaphores and 
how to work with them which will lead to planning out my implementation. I also want to look into exactly how the bash script for the 
assignment should be written, however making sure I'm well ahead on the dining-p program is the main priority.

This is my second README entry for Lab 4. After a few days of working on the project, I'm able to notice just how much of this is review 
of previous labs and how all of these ideas continue to stack on top of each other. Part 1 at least felt very much like this other than 
some catching up I had to do on sem_open and the oflag argument. Part 2 on the other hand didn't require a lot of work, but I did have 
to think about two different approaches to preventing deadlock. I ultimately chose to go with the removal of circular wait and having 
all my philosophers be left-handed besides the philosopher in position 1 who I would make right-handed.

This is my third README entry for Lab 4. I'm at the point of going over the project description and making sure my program covers all 
steps from the first two parts and is able to run properly for the individual philosopher. Once I've cleared that up, I'm choosing to 
avoid part 3 which is optional and just go ahead and write the bash script to allow the program to run multiple times. This file 
shouldn't take too long to make but it is something I haven't attempted before.

This is my fourth and final README entry for Lab 4. The bash script is finished and after several tests and adjustments, I have the program 
running multiple times. I'm able to use the kill command to terminate each process one by one with no occurances of errors. I'm very 
satisfied with the results as well as my time management throughout this previous week on the project. This was the last assignment I will 
be turning in past its due date without a late penalty since the final three labs are all due on May 8th which is the last day of the 
regular semester. There's a lot of work to be done for 322 and I just want to give it my best effort. After a poorly attempted Lab 0, I 
knew I had to regain a strong work ethic if I wanted to pass this class. Ever since Lab 1, I feel more confident with taking on these 
assignments, and now with the little time I have left I want to make sure I can have everything turned in within the next week.
