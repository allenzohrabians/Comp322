This is my first README entry for Lab 4. I went over the dining philosopher problem through my readings of the textbook from a few weeks 
back. Now looking over the project description, I have a good idea on how to begin but will continue doing research on semaphores and 
how to work with them which will lead to planning out my implementation. I also want to look into exactly how the bash script for the 
assignment should be written, however making sure I'm well ahead on the dining-p program is the main priority.

This is my second README entry for Lab 4. After a few days of working on the project, I'm able to notice just how much of this is review of 
previous labs and how all of these ideas continue to stack on top of each other. Part 1 at least felt very much like this other than some 
catching up I had to do on sem_open and the oflag argument. Part 2 on the other hand didn't require a lot of work, but I did have to think 
about two different approaches to preventing deadlock. I ultimately chose to go with the removal of circular wait and having all my 
philosophers be left-handed besides the philosopher in position 1 who I would make right-handed.
