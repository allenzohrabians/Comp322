This is my README entry for Lab 5. Transitioning from Lab 4 which took me about a week to complete, I was expecting another lengthy 
assignment to follow. However, this was a rather simple problem from the textbook that involved passing in a virtual address into the 
command line and having it output the page number and offset. It was also very helpful that I had a similar assignment that I completed 
during the previous semester in Comp 222. I was able to finish Lab 5 in about 40 minutes and only had to write roughly 25 lines of code. 
I'm glad I immediately targeted this assignment and was able to get it out of the way as quick as I did. Most of my time is going to have 
to go into Labs 6 and 7 which I will be consistently working on each day until they're due on May 8th.
