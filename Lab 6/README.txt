This is my first README entry for Lab 6. There is a lot to do at the moment involving finals preparation, but these last two projects must 
be a priority as well. The assignment's description provides some familiarity with signal handeling but I do feel like there is a lot of 
review to be done before fully understanding each task to perform. It does help reading the entire document a few times and isolating each 
part one by one. After some pre-planning and organizing of work for other courses, I'll be able to start getting to work.
