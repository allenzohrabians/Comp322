This is my first README entry for Lab 6. There is a lot to do at the moment involving finals preparation, but these last two projects 
must be a priority as well. The assignment's description provides some familiarity with signal handeling but I do feel like there is a 
lot of review to be done before fully understanding each task to perform. It does help reading the entire document a few times and 
isolating each part one by one. After some pre-planning and organizing of work for other courses, I'll be able to start getting to 
work.

This is my second and final README entry for Lab 6. It's been exactly two weeks since my initial look at the project, and it has been 
a difficult time managing everything from my 4 other courses. However, since completing all my finals on Wednesday I have been able to 
simultaneously work on Labs 6 and 7 throughout the last couple of days. I was able to finally complete both assignments late Saturday. 
Lab 6 in my opinion was the easier of the two, although my time management had not allowed for really any thought or attempt during 
finals preparation. I am satisfied with my work on it given the workload I had upon myself since the end of April, and feel as though 
I finished off the semester to the best of my abilities.
