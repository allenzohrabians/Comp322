Saturday (2/29/2020): This is my first README entry for Lab 1. We were just introduced to the project and I initially began my approach by looking up the various functions required for the assignment through the C library. This includes time(), fork(), waitpid(), and getpid(). I prefer to do this off the bat so I can begin developing ideas on how to implement them before starting to code.
